# yu-chern-Uncertainty-Estimation-for-Deep-Medical-Image-Segmentation
This is a research project provided by the company Carl Zeiss and collabrated with TUM Data Innovation Lab. 
The project implement and compared six uncertainty estimation methods applied on the segmentation results of a medical image dataset namely [RETOUCH](https://retouch.grand-challenge.org/Home/). The dataset consists of a collection of retina BScans of human eyes and their corresponding ground truth annotation created by experts. The results of this project can be used to support the construction of automatical segmentation system for medical usage.  

For the python code of this project please contact [Martin Hermann](martin.hermann@tum.de).  

The pipeline of the project is shown as the following image:
